Overview
</Text>

We're making a platformer game on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#player.py) using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).
In the past few weeks, we've been brainstorming on a [Google document (log in on sandi.net account)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mbBj6xFfJdRxxKmRbBd0Lxb15YBNTS3kW1SdQeSIIA/edit?usp=sharing).
We've been discussing about creating a game that takes place on either the MEA Campus or on Mt. Everest (the mountain).
The game is not finalized yet; we will continue to brainstorm as we continue to make progress, so please email us if you have any suggestions!

Making this game won't be possible without people pitching in outside of club hours :).
Here are some guidelines for contributing:

Pixel Art/Sprite Making

As stated in the overview, we're thinking of having the setting of the game to be on either the **Mt. Everest mountain** or the **Mt. Everest Academy campus**. 
Try to make your art follow this theme. Some things we need to have sprites for
1. Enemies
2. Background (icy mountain?)
