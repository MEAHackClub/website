[Slynyrd's pixel art blog](www.raymond-schlitter.squarespace.com/pixelblog-catalogue)  
[Creating character sprites](www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdoycEGHye0)  
[Sprite-making general overview](www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_EKrg2fIuc) 

We would recommend taking a look at Slynyrd's pixel blog first—it goes very in depth, and explains different design concepts well. 
Rather than using the various sprite editing software that they recommend, use piskel—its free, and serves its purpose well.
