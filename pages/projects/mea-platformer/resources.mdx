#### **Prerequisites:**  
[*Classes*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)   
[*Functions*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)    
#### **The \__init\__() method + player/enemy properties**  
The player and enemy [classes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) are found in [enemy.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#enemy.py) and [player.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#player.py). Shown in the \__init\__() function, they share the same movement properties, including:
- `rect`, the hitbox of the player/enemy
- `air_timer`, the amount of time the player/enemy is in the air
- `movement`, stores vertical and horizontal movement of the player/enemy. It's an [array](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp) with two values - `[x, y]`. The first value, `x`, represents horizontal movement, and the second value, `y`, represents vertical movement.
- `direction`, horizontal direction of player/enemy. -1 = moving left, 0 = not moving horizontally, 1 = moving right.
- `y_momentum`, vertical speed of the enemy/player.
