## Adding a Map
</Text>

To add a map, simply 
1. go to the maps folder and 
2. create a new file named `map[last map number+1]`. For example, if the last map was named `map2`, name your map `map3`. 

Each number represents a block in the world. 
To see which available blocks you can paint the map with, go to [map.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#map.py).
In the `draw` function, there should be a list of all the numbers and sprites to paint the map with.
See [adding sprites](#adding-sprites) to add your own tile to paint the map with.

## Adding Sprites + How to add it as a tile
</Text>

1. Upload a png image into the `img` folder
2. Go to [sprites.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#sprites.py) and add in this (replace spriteName and fileName with your sprite name and file name):
```python
spriteName = pygame.image.load('img/fileName.png');
```
### Adding the sprite as a tile
1. In the [map.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#map.py) file, find the `draw()` function.
2. Below the two for loops, find the code that looks like this: 
```python
if tile == '1':
    display.blit(sprites.dirt, (x * TILE_SIZE, y * TILE_SIZE))
elif tile == '2':
    display.blit(sprites.grass, (x * TILE_SIZE, y * TILE_SIZE))
```
3. From [sprites.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#sprites.py) add in your sprite at the **end** of the rest of the tile like below, replacing spriteName with the actual spriteName and the lastNumber+1 with 1 + the last number (the number you're assigning the tile to). 
```python
elif tile == 'lastNumber+1':
    display.blit(sprites.spriteName, (x * TILE_SIZE, y * TILE_SIZE))
```
Now you can [add the tile in a map](#adding-a-map) using the tile number you assigned it to!

## Adding an Enemy
</Text>

1. Make sure you [added a sprite for your enemy](#adding-sprites). Make sure the name of the sprite is the name of your enemy.
2. Go to [main.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#main.py) and scroll down to around line 19. You should see:
```
player = Player(pygame.Rect(50, 50, sprites.player.get_width(), sprites.player.get_height()))
enemy = Enemy(pygame.Rect(50, 50, sprites.enemy.get_width(), sprites.enemy.get_height())
``` 
3. Add in your own enemy like this (replacing the 3 enemyName references with your actual enemy name):
```
enemyName = Enemy(pygame.Rect(50, 50, sprites.enemyName.get_width(), sprites.enemyName.get_height())
```
4. Go to the game loop. Add the enemy on the display like this (again, replacing the 2 enemyName references):
```python
display.blit(sprites.enemyName, (enemyName.rect.x, enemyName.rect.y))
```
5. Below the movement, add this line (replacing the enemyName reference).
```
enemyName.moveRoutine(pygame, map, player)
```
Run the code; the enemy should be in there!

## The player and enemy class
</Text>

#### **Prerequisites:**  
[*Classes*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)   
[*Functions*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)    
#### **The \__init\__() constructor + player/enemy properties**  
The player and enemy [classes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) are found in [enemy.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#enemy.py) and [player.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#player.py). Shown in the \__init\__() function, they share the same movement properties, including:
- `rect`, the hitbox of the player/enemy
- `air_timer`, the amount of time the player/enemy is in the air
- `movement`, stores vertical and horizontal movement of the player/enemy. It's an [array](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp) with two values - `[x, y]`. The first value, `x`, represents horizontal movement, and the second value, `y`, represents vertical movement.
- `direction`, horizontal direction of player/enemy. -1 = moving left, 0 = not moving horizontally, 1 = moving right.
- `y_momentum`, vertical speed of the enemy/player.
#### Player functions
- `collides`: [returns](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_return_value.asp) true if the player is colliding the `rect` passed in as a [parameter](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp#:~:text=A%20parameter%20is%20the%20variable,function%20when%20it%20is%20called).
- `move`: moves the player based off of the player's direction, collisions, and y_momentum. [Called](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_call.asp) in main.py.
- `getMovementInput`: gets WASD input from the keyboard.
#### Enemy functions
- `moveRoutine`: moves enemy in a routine.
- `moveRight`, `stopMovement`, and `moveLeft`: moves enemy right, left, or stops movement.
- `move`: moves the player based off of the enemy's direction, collisions, and y_momentum. [Called](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_call.asp) in main.py.
