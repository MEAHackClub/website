Adding a map
</Text>

To add a map, simply 
1. go to the maps folder and 
2. create a new file named `map[last map number+1]`. For example, if the last map was named `map2`, name your map `map3`. 

Each number represents a block in the world. 
To see which available blocks you can paint the map with, go to [map.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#map.py).
In the `draw` function, there should be a list of all the numbers and sprites to paint the map with.
See [adding sprites](#adding-a-map) (coming soon) to add your own sprite to paint the map with.

#### **Prerequisites:**  
[*Classes*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)   
[*Functions*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)    
#### **The \__init\__() constructor + player/enemy properties**  
The player and enemy [classes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) are found in [enemy.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#enemy.py) and [player.py](https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer#player.py). Shown in the \__init\__() function, they share the same movement properties, including:
- `rect`, the hitbox of the player/enemy
- `air_timer`, the amount of time the player/enemy is in the air
- `movement`, stores vertical and horizontal movement of the player/enemy. It's an [array](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp) with two values - `[x, y]`. The first value, `x`, represents horizontal movement, and the second value, `y`, represents vertical movement.
- `direction`, horizontal direction of player/enemy. -1 = moving left, 0 = not moving horizontally, 1 = moving right.
- `y_momentum`, vertical speed of the enemy/player.
#### Player functions
- `collides`: [returns](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_return_value.asp) true if the player is colliding the `rect` passed in as a [parameter](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp#:~:text=A%20parameter%20is%20the%20variable,function%20when%20it%20is%20called).
- `move`: moves the player based off of the player's direction, collisions, and y_momentum. [Called](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_call.asp) in main.py.
- `getMovementInput`: gets WASD input from the keyboard.
#### Enemy functions
- `moveRoutine`: moves enemy in a routine.
- `moveRight`, `stopMovement`, and `moveLeft`: moves enemy right, left, or stops movement.
- `move`: moves the player based off of the enemy's direction, collisions, and y_momentum. [Called](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_call.asp) in main.py.
