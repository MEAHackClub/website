Overview

We're making a platformer game on <a href="https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer" target="_blank"> repl.it </a> using <a href="https://www.pygame.org/" target="_blank"> pygame </a>
In the past few weeks, we've been brainstorming on a [Google document (log into sandi.net account)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mbBj6xFfJdRxxKmRbBd0Lxb15YBNTS3kW1SdQeSIIA/edit?usp=sharing).
We've been discussing about creating a game that takes place on either the MEA Campus or on Mt. Everest (the mountain).
The game is not finalized yet; we will continue to brainstorm as we continue to make progress, so please email us if you have any suggestions!

How to contribute
</Text>

Making this game won't be possible without people pitching in outside of club hours :).
Here are some guidelines for contributing:

Pixel Art/Sprite Making
</Text>

As stated in the [overview](#overview), we're thinking of having the setting of the game to be on either the **Mt. Everest mountain** or the **Mt. Everest Academy campus**. 
Try to make your art follow this theme. Instructions for making pixel art: 

1. [Choose something on the list](mea-platformer/sprites/todo) that's not already assigned or think of your own!
Again, we are still accepting ideas for the game, so if you have an idea for pixel art outside of this list, feel free to make it and send it to us!
2. Email us at <hackclubmea@gmail.com> with your completed pixel art for us to review.

If you would like to contribute to the code, follow these instructions:

1. <a href="https://youtu.be/wa1qa3tkkX4" target="_blank">Create a repl.it fork</a> (so everyone's changes won't interfere with each other)
2. [Find something you want to do](mea-platformer/todo) and make desired changes
3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rDQyVYWLHK0" target="_blank">Create a GitHub repo</a>, and email us at <a href="mailto:hackclubmea@gmail.com">hackclubmea@gmail.com</a> so we can create a pull request to merge the code with the main repository.
