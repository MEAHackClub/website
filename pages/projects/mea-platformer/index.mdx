We're making a platformer game on <a href="https://repl.it/@ShawnZhuang/MEA-Platformer" target="_blank"> repl.it </a> using <a href="https://www.pygame.org/" target="_blank"> pygame </a>
In the past few weeks, we've been brainstorming on a [Google document (log into sandi.net account)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mbBj6xFfJdRxxKmRbBd0Lxb15YBNTS3kW1SdQeSIIA/edit?usp=sharing).
We've been discussing about creating a game that takes place on either the MEA Campus or on Mt. Everest (the mountain).
The game is not finalized yet; we will continue to brainstorm as we continue to make progress, so please email us if you have any suggestions!

How to contribute

Making this game won't be possible without people pitching in outside of club hours :).
Here are some guidelines for contributing:

Pixel Art/Sprite Making
</Text>

As stated in the [overview](#overview), we're thinking of having the setting of the game to be on either the **Mt. Everest mountain** or the **Mt. Everest Academy campus**. 
Try to make your art follow this theme. Some pixel art we'll need (assignments in parentheses):

1. Sprites
    - Main character (AJ)
    - Enemies
    - Obstacles (AJ)
2. Background 
    - Icy mountain (Kaeleb)
    - MEA Campus
3. Tilemaps 
    - Icy roads (Blake)

Once you are done with your art, email <meahackclub@gmail.com> and we'll tell you what to do from there!
Again, we are still accepting ideas for the game, so if you have an idea for pixel art outside of this list, feel free to make it and send it to us!

If you would like to contribute to the code, follow these instructions:

1. Create a repl.it fork (so everyone's changes won't interfere with each other)
2. Make desired changes
3. Email us,  and we'll look over the code and help you create a pull request (merge new code into main repl)

```
this is code
